# Survival-Stars
Survival Stars is a fast-paced survival game where the player must stay alive as long as possible in a confined map. Using WASD keys to move and the mouse to aim and shoot, players collect randomly spawning stars to earn points while avoiding or destroying approaching enemies. Each collision with an enemy reduces the player's health, starting with 3 lives. Health potions spawn occasionally, allowing the player to regain lost lives. As time progresses, enemies increase in number and speed, raising the difficulty level. The goal is to survive for as long as possible and achieve a high score.
